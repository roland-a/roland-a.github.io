        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Roland, a graduate from the University of Florida with a bachelor's in Computer Science.
            I have a passion for creating software and a dedication to mastering my craft.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am quick to pick up on languages and frameworks and have experience with the following languages.

            This is the first large project I have created.
            It is a mod for the game Minecraft that adds infinitely varied landscapes.
            Most other terrain mods I tried only add in multiple predefined biomes.
            These predefined biomes tend to have little variations within and do not seamlessly transition between biomes.
            I wanted to make a terrain generator that makes every area feel unique and seamless.
            This is why I created Infinibiome.
            Instead of predefined biomes, every world feature such as amplitude, slope, temperature, humidity, etc., are varied and independent.

            Here are more <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infinibiome/screenshots/">images</a> of some of the landscapes this mod generates.

            This is another Minecraft mod I have created.
            Minecraft without any mods tends to feel unpolished.
            There are a lot of small features missing that I feel would enhance the gameplay.
            In Unaverage-Tweaks, I attempt to add every feature I feel is greatly needed.
            I also wanted to share with other players this mod who might want to play with some of these features.
            Of course, not every other player who wants to use this mod might agree with everything, so I made every feature configurable and disableable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the <a href="unaverage_tweaks.html">wiki</a> that demonstrates every new feature I added.

            This is another Minecraft mod that is in development.
            After being frustrated with procedure terrain generation with Infinibiome, and after seeing the recent bloom of AI technology, I came up with a new idea.
            What if I were to use generative AI to generate good-looking terrain?
            I decided to have this idea be my senior design project, leading a team of two others.
            After weeks of hard work, we came up with a working proof concept with these requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>The generated world size can be any arbitrary size</li>
                <li>The model must generate elevation data that are very similar to the real-life elevation it's trained on</li>
                <li>Multiple models can work seamlessly together to create multiple biomes within a generated world.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For our proof of concept, we decided to use two models: one based on a real mountain and another based on a real desert.
            First, we have an arbitrary biome map.
            Yellow represents deserts, and gray represents mountains:
            <div>
                <img src="assets/ml_craft/biomes.png">
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we use our desert model to generate deserts where it's yellow on the map, and our mountain model to generate mountains where it's gray:
            <div>
                <img src="assets/ml_craft/results.png">
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            MLCraft is still in its infancy.
            There are still a lot of new features that need to be added before it can be officially released.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a roadmap of the features that will be added next:
            <ul>
                <li><s>Create a working proof of concept.</s></li>
                <li><s>Have the generated elevation data be playable in Minecraft.</s></li>
                <li>Add oceans and beaches to the biome-map generator.</li>
                <li>Use better-trained models.</li>
                <li>Add more models.</li>
                <li>Move the models from Python to Java.</li>
                <li>Have the elevation data be generated on the Create World screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
