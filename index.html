        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Roland, a senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Florida.
            I am graduating from UF in Spring 2024.
            I have a passion for creating software and a dedication to mastering my craft.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am quick to pick up on languages and frameworks and have experience with the following languages.

            This is the first large project I have created.
            It is a mod for the game Minecraft that adds infinitely varied landscapes.
            Most other terrain mods I tried only add in multiple predefined biomes.
            These predefined biomes tend to have little variations within and did not seamlessly transition between biomes.
            I wanted to make a terrain generator that makes every area feel unique and seamless.
            This is why I created Infinibiome.
            Instead of predefined biomes, every world feature such as amplitude, slope, temperature, humidity, etc., are varied and independent.
        </p>

            Here is a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infinibiome/screenshots/">gallery</a> of some of the landscapes this mod generates.

            This is another Minecraft mod I have created.
            Normal Minecraft without any mods tends to feel unpolished.
            There are a lot of small features missing that I feel would enhance the gameplay greatly.
            In Unaverage Tweak, I attempt to add every feature I feel is greatly needed.
            Of course, not every other player who wants to use this mod might agree with everything, so I made every feature configurable and disableable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the <a href="unaverage_tweaks.html">wiki</a> that demonstrates every new feature I added.
